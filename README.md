# Employee-Management-System

## GUI-Based Employee Management System using SQLite 3 and Pyqt5

In this project, I have designed an application using Pyqt5 and SQLite to manage all employees of a hypothetical company.
Each employee has an Employee Id (which acts as Primary Key for our table), Name, Lastname, Age, Position, and Email address. This Company will hire people who are older than 18 and younger than 70 years old.
I have defined a function to generate 40 employees with fake information.
